Now, let's move on to the seventh step: "Choose Development Tools."

### Choose Development Tools:

#### Select a Language:
1. **JavaScript:**
   - Given that you specified JavaScript for your game, it's a versatile language suitable for web-based game development.
   - You can use it with HTML5 and the canvas element for rendering graphics.

#### Learn Tools:
1. **HTML5 Canvas API:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the Canvas API for drawing graphics on the web page.
   - Understand how to create and manipulate 2D graphics within the canvas element.

2. **JavaScript:**
   - Enhance your JavaScript skills, focusing on topics like event handling, arrays, and basic game logic.
   - Consider learning about ES6 features for cleaner and more modern JavaScript code.

#### Example:
For a web-based Snake game using JavaScript and HTML5:
- **HTML:**
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>Snake Game</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
      <canvas id="gameCanvas" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
      <script src="game.js"></script>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```
- **JavaScript (game.js):**
  ```javascript
  // Your game logic goes here
  ```

By choosing JavaScript and HTML5, you can leverage the web browser as the platform for your Snake game. This allows for easy accessibility and sharing through web hosting or platforms like GitHub Pages.

Additionally, as you advance in your development journey, you might explore libraries and frameworks such as Phaser.js for more advanced game development features. Phaser.js, in particular, is popular for building 2D games in JavaScript and can offer a range of tools and utilities to streamline development. However, starting with raw JavaScript and the Canvas API is a great way to understand the fundamentals of game development.
