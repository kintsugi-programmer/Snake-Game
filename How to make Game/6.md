Let's move on to the sixth step: "Specify Functions."

### Specify Functions:

#### List Features:
1. **Move Snake:**
   - Function to update the snake's position based on its current direction.
   - Handles the continuous movement of the snake.

2. **Check Collision:**
   - Function to detect collisions between the snake and walls or itself.
   - Determines whether the game should continue or end based on collisions.

3. **Generate Food:**
   - Function to create new food items at random positions on the grid.
   - Ensures that food does not overlap with the snake.

4. **Handle Input:**
   - Function to listen for user input (arrow keys).
   - Updates the snake's direction according to the pressed key.

5. **Update Score (if applicable):**
   - Function to update the player's score when the snake consumes food.
   - Adds points based on the game's scoring system.

#### Define Functions:
1. **Move Snake Function:**
   ```javascript
   function moveSnake() {
       // Update the position of each segment of the snake.
       // Move the head in the current direction.
       // Update the positions of the body segments.
   }
   ```

2. **Check Collision Function:**
   ```javascript
   function checkCollision() {
       // Check if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
       // If collision occurs, end the game.
   }
   ```

3. **Generate Food Function:**
   ```javascript
   function generateFood() {
       // Create a new food item at a random position on the grid.
       // Ensure the food does not overlap with the snake.
   }
   ```

4. **Handle Input Function:**
   ```javascript
   function handleInput(event) {
       // Listen for arrow key input.
       // Update the snake's direction based on the pressed key.
   }
   ```

5. **Update Score Function (if applicable):**
   ```javascript
   function updateScore() {
       // If the snake consumes food, update the player's score.
       // Add points based on the scoring system.
   }
   ```

These functions provide a clear outline of the specific tasks each component needs to perform in your Snake game. As you progress with the implementation, you can flesh out these functions with the necessary code to bring your game to life. Remember to keep your functions modular and focused on specific tasks to maintain a clean and organized codebase.
