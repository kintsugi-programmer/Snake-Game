Certainly! Let's dive into more detail for the second step: "Outline Game Mechanics."

### Outline Game Mechanics:

#### Player Actions:
Specify how players will interact with your Snake game. In the classic Snake game:
- **Controls:** Use arrow keys to direct the snake's movement. Decide if you want to include alternative controls or additional input methods.
- **Movement:** Define how the snake moves. Does it continuously slither in the chosen direction, or does it move one grid unit at a time?

#### Rules:
Establish the fundamental rules that govern your Snake game:
- **Growth Mechanism:** Outline how the snake grows. Typically, it consumes food to increase in length.
- **Collision Detection:** Specify what happens when the snake collides with different elements, such as walls or itself.
- **Winning/Losing Conditions:** Clarify when the player wins (e.g., reaching a certain length) and when they lose (e.g., colliding with obstacles).

#### Example:
In your Snake game, you decide to keep it simple:
- **Controls:** Arrow keys control the snake's movement.
- **Movement:** The snake moves continuously in the current direction.
- **Growth Mechanism:** Eating food increases the snake's length.
- **Collision Detection:** Game over if the snake collides with the game board's boundaries or itself.
- **Winning/Losing Conditions:** The player wins by reaching a certain length, and they lose upon collision.

This clarity in outlining game mechanics provides a roadmap for the implementation phase. It guides you when coding the snake's movement, handling collisions, and implementing win/lose conditions. Additionally, you can refer back to these mechanics as a reference while designing and coding other aspects of your game.
