Let's proceed to the eighth step: "Start Coding."

### Start Coding:

#### Set Up Project:
1. **HTML Structure:**
   - Create an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) with the basic structure, including a canvas element for rendering the game.
  
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Snake Game</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   </head>
   <body>
       <canvas id="gameCanvas" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
       <script src="game.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. **JavaScript File:**
   - Create a JavaScript file (e.g., `game.js`) where you'll implement the game logic.
   
   ```javascript
   // game.js
   // Your game logic will go here
   ```

#### Implement Core Features:
1. **Initialize the Canvas:**
   - In your JavaScript file, get a reference to the canvas and its context.
   
   ```javascript
   const canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');
   const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
   ```

2. **Draw the Snake:**
   - Implement a function to draw the snake on the canvas.

   ```javascript
   function drawSnake() {
       // Your code to draw the snake on the canvas goes here
   }
   ```

3. **Handle User Input:**
   - Implement an event listener to handle arrow key input and update the snake's direction.

   ```javascript
   document.addEventListener('keydown', handleInput);
   
   function handleInput(event) {
       // Your code to update the snake's direction based on user input goes here
   }
   ```

4. **Move the Snake:**
   - Implement a function to update the snake's position based on its direction.

   ```javascript
   function moveSnake() {
       // Your code to move the snake goes here
   }
   ```

5. **Draw the Game Board:**
   - Draw the initial state of the game board.

   ```javascript
   function drawGameBoard() {
       // Your code to draw the game board goes here
   }
   ```

6. **Main Game Loop:**
   - Set up a main game loop that continuously updates and renders the game.

   ```javascript
   function gameLoop() {
       // Your code for the main game loop goes here
   }
   
   // Start the game loop
   setInterval(gameLoop, 1000 / 10);  // Update every 100 milliseconds (adjust as needed)
   ```

This initial setup provides the foundation for your Snake game. As you progress, you'll continue to build on these functions, adding features such as food generation, collision detection, and scoring. Test your game frequently to catch and address any issues as you implement additional functionalities.
