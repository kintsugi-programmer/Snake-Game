Certainly! Below are the headings with links to corresponding markdown files:

### 1. [Define Your Game Concept](1.md):
   - **Idea Generation:** Your Snake game will involve a snake that moves on a grid, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

### 2. [Outline Game Mechanics](2.md):
   - **Player Actions:** Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
   - **Rules:** The snake grows longer after eating food. Game over if the snake collides with walls or itself.

### 3. [Create a Game Design Document (GDD)](3.md):
   - **Document Everything:** Specify the grid size (e.g., 20x20), initial snake length, how food appears, and how the score is calculated.
   - **Visualize:** Sketch a grid-based representation of the game board and movements.

### 4. [Break Down into Components](4.md):
   - **Identify Components:** Consider components like the game board, snake, food, input handler, and score tracker.
   - **Define Responsibilities:** For example, the input handler updates the snake's direction, and the game board manages the grid and collision detection.

### 5. [Plan Your Stages](5.md):
   - **Prototyping:** Create a basic HTML file with a grid and a JavaScript file to handle snake movement. Test the basic mechanics.
   - **Iterate:** Gradually add features like food generation, collision detection, and scoring. Continuously test and refine.

### 6. [Specify Functions](6.md):
   - **List Features:** Define functions for updating the snake's position, checking collisions, generating food, and handling user input.
   - **Define Functions:** Examples include `moveSnake()`, `checkCollision()`, `generateFood()`, `handleInput()`, etc.

### 7. [Choose Development Tools](7.md):
   - **Select a Language:** You're using JavaScript. Consider using HTML5 canvas for the game board and JavaScript for the game logic.
   - **Learn Tools:** Familiarize yourself with the canvas API and basic JavaScript syntax.

### 8. [Start Coding](8.md):
   - **Set Up Project:** Create an HTML file for the game board and a JavaScript file for the game logic.
   - **Implement Core Features:** Start by setting up the game board on the canvas, creating a snake that moves with arrow keys, and handling basic collisions.

### 9. [Iterate and Test](9.md):
   - **Continuous Testing:** Test your game after each new feature is added. Ensure the snake moves correctly, food appears, and collisions are detected.
   - **User Feedback:** Share your game with others to gather feedback and make improvements.

### 10. [Polish and Refine](10.md):
   - **Graphics and Sound:** Enhance the visuals by styling the HTML elements and canvas. You can also add simple sounds using the Web Audio API.
   - **Optimize:** Refactor your code for readability and performance. Consider adding features like a scoring system or different game levels.

### 11. [Publish and Share](11.md):
   - **Release:** Host your game on a website or share the code on platforms like GitHub. Allow others to play and provide feedback.

### Additional Tips:
   - **Learn about the Canvas API:** Familiarize yourself with drawing on the HTML5 canvas, as it will be essential for rendering the game board and elements.
   - **Use Event Listeners:** Set up event listeners for keyboard input to control the snake.
   - **Explore External Libraries:** Consider using libraries like Phaser.js for more advanced game development features.
